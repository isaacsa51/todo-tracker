# TODO Tracker WebApp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is a pure serverless project just to practice vanilla ReactJS due an interview that I going to have in those days...

## Available Scripts

#### In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the JSON server _`db.json`_ which locates all the "data" that storages the webapp of this project.
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the data that storages the server.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
